# Homework2

 - Set the media queries each of the bottom part of HTML; about, portfolio, contacts.

 - Adjusted the breakpoint so that it doesn't look weird betweens
   : one between 980px and 769px, one between 768px and 641px, and the last is just 640px and less.

 - Made the each contents' width in the second row 650px, 630px, and 600px in About, Portfolio, Contacts repectively.
   So that it has appopriate margins to look nicely as the screen shrinks.

 - Given the size of 640px each on Name and Nav so that they have each row on their own in About page.

 - Figure out with display:block;, float:none; to the profile photo from staying still regarless of screen shrinks in About page.

 - In Contacts, the adopted email form, the each blanks adjusted to 84% from 100%

 - In Portfolio, the adjusted container allowed the photos set nicely as the screen shrinks

 - Updated photos of Portfolio.
